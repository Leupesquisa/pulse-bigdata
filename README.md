## Description, Goal & Context

The project aims to develop a secure and scalable system for authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This system is designed to protect critical endpoints and allow only authenticated users to access sensitive application resources. The project context involves the integration of RESTful services, where security and data protection are of utmost importance.

The project was developed as part of a broader platform that includes real-time economic and financial monitoring features. JWT authentication is essential to ensure that only authorized users can access and interact with these functionalities.

## Technologies

### Used Technologies

The project utilizes a combination of modern and widely adopted technologies in the development of secure web applications:

* **Java 17:** The main programming language used for backend development.
* **Spring Boot 3.x:** Framework used to create self-contained, production-ready Spring applications.
* **Spring Security:** Used to configure application security, manage authentication and authorization.
* **Jakarta EE:** Set of specifications used for developing robust and scalable enterprise applications.
* **JWT (JSON Web Token):** Token-based authentication standard used for user authentication and API endpoint protection.
* **Mongo DB:** NO SQL database used for testing and local development.
* **JUnit 5:** Testing framework used to write and execute unit tests.
* **Mockito:** Framework for creating mocks, used in tests to simulate the behavior of external components.
* **Maven:** Build automation and dependency management tool.

These technologies were chosen to ensure the system is secure, scalable, and easy to maintain, as well as allowing it to integrate efficiently with other parts of the application. The use of Spring Security with JWT provides a stateless authentication model, essential for modern distributed systems.
